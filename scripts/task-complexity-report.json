      "expansionPrompt": "Generate detailed subtasks for 'Implement Cart System', focusing on these five main components:\n1. Zustand Store (useCart.ts): Define state (items with adult/child/infant quantities, dates), actions (add, remove, update item, update quantity, update date, clear cart), and total price calculation logic.\n2. API Endpoints (/api/cart): Design and implement RESTful endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting cart items, interacting with Firebase as the backend. Specify request/response schemas.\n3. Synchronization Logic: Detail the process for synchronizing the cart state between local storage and Firebase, including handling scenarios like user login, logout, and potential offline changes.\n4. UI Components: List the necessary UI components for the cart (e.g., cart item display, cart summary, quantity pickers for adult/child/infant, date selectors) and their functionalities for user interaction.\n5. Error Handling & Edge Cases: Identify potential errors and edge cases (e.g., item not found, invalid quantity, API failures, sync conflicts) and outline strategies for handling them gracefully in both UI and backend logic.",
      "reasoning": "The task complexity is high (8/10) due to its multifaceted nature, involving frontend state management (Zustand), UI development with specific input requirements (quantities per type, dates), backend API development (/api/cart), integration with Firebase, and crucial synchronization logic between local storage and the backend. Each of these areas represents a significant piece of work with interdependencies, requiring careful planning and execution."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Generate subtasks for 'Implement Checkout System'. Focus on: 1. Creating the `useOrder.ts` Zustand store for managing order-specific data. 2. Creating the `useCheckout.ts` Zustand store for managing checkout process state. 3. Building UI components for collecting order and traveler information. 4. Building UI components for handling special requests, payment method selection, and terms agreement. 5. Implementing comprehensive input validation for all checkout form fields. 6. Integrating session storage for persisting temporary order state. 7. Developing robust error handling and edge case management for the entire checkout flow.",
      "reasoning": "This task is complex due to its multifaceted nature, involving UI development for multiple information sections, state management with two separate Zustand stores, client-side data persistence via session storage, comprehensive input validation, and critical error/edge case handling. Each of these areas represents a significant unit of work."
