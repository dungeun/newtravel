Line 2214: Build failed due to a user error: Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2
Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:
The build failure is due to import errors in the `page.tsx` file. Specifically, the error states that `'routeConfig' is not exported from '../route-config'`.
These errors are causing the build to fail due to attempted imports that are not exported correctly.
By resolving the export issue in the `route-config` file, the build should proceed without import errors.
